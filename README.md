# ExData_Plotting1
Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

IMPORTANT

For time and space purposes, I have written an additional script called "globalscript" for loading the data only once, and viewing the four plots faster. The function is called "plotting" and takes as it´s only argument the number of the plot, ie.: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Other than that, you just need to set your working directory to where the data is sotred at, in the spaces specified whithin the code. 

I decided not to comment the code itself for it´s simplicity. 

Last thing, Times and dates gave me a bit of problem. For that reason, didn´t translate the days names.
