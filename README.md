Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

IMPORTANT

First: I had issues with gitbash this time. As the due date came closer, the only thing that I could do in order to upload my files, was to use push --force command, which overrided every existent file in the repo. For that reason you wont see mr. Peng´s files but under the repo name, you will be able to see it´s origin. Just in case.

Second: For time and space purposes, I have written an additional script called "globalscript" for loading the data only once, and viewing the four plots faster. The function is called "plotting" and takes as it´s only argument the number of the plot, ie.: 1, 2, 3, 4. Feel free to check the individual codes for each plot, or this global script for viewing all of them. 

Other than that, you just need to set your working directory to where the data is sotred at, in the spaces specified whithin the code. 

I decided not to comment the code itself for it´s simplicity. 

Last thing, Times and dates gave me a bit of problem. For that reason, didn´t translate the days names.
