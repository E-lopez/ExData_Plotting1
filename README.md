# ExData_Plotting1
Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

IMPORTANT

For time and space purposes, I have written an additional scritp called "globalscript" for loading the data only once, and viewing the four plots faster. The function is called "plotting" and takes as only argument the mumbre of the plot to see, ie.: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Other than that, you just need to set your working directory to where the data is sotred at, in the places specified in the code. 

I decided not to comment the code itself for it´s simplicity. 

Last thing, Times and dates gave me a bit of problems. For that reason, didn´t translate the days names.
